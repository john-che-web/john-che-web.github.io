Hi, I’m John Che, and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in [Computer Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/electrical-computer-engineering/) and a Master’s degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My work focuses on designing scalable, responsible systems at the intersection of machine learning, information security, and data engineering that turn complex data into actionable insights while prioritizing equity and accessibility.

As an Operations Research Fellow with the [University of Wisconsin System Office of Information Security](https://www.wisconsin.edu/offices/), I lead initiatives analyzing terabytes of log and telemetry data across 13 campuses, building cloud-native pipelines, ETL workflows, and data visualizations that enhance security analytics and decision-making.

My research spans quantitative and human-centered methods. I have developed resource-efficient distributed architectures for multilingual NLP models, improving performance while drastically reducing hardware costs, and conducted a qualitative study on passkey adoption that produced a novel taxonomy of platform-level usability barriers. These projects reflect my philosophy of ensuring technology is both high-performing and socially responsible.

I have also applied these principles in public-interest contexts, such as building a HIPAA-compliant data platform for mental health clinics at the [Wisconsin Department of Health](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/), where I identified systemic constraints and designed solutions that empowered under-resourced organizations serving over 70,000 Wisconsin residents.

Beyond research, I am committed to mentorship and community engagement. I have served on the Advisory Board for UW–Madison’s Department of Computer Science and support initiatives advancing diversity and equitable opportunities in computing.

I aim to build resilient, intelligent, and equitable data systems that help organizations and communities make better decisions, and I bring a unique combination of technical mastery, human-centered research, and policy awareness to every project.
